# History of the SERC Project

## SERC-Flow v1 (January 2026)
Prototype version using a 2D mapper (E, V) with softmax normalization.
Identified key limitations and motivated the development of SERC v2.

## SERC Framework (Published)
Core relational metric framework:
- simplex geometry,
- Gram metric,
- relational tension Ω,
- internal time.

## SERC v2.0 – Technical Report
Full 4D mapper (S, E, R, C), empirical validation, adaptive guardrail.

## SERC v2.1 – Mathematical Foundations
Formal stability analysis:
- projected gradient flow,
- Lyapunov stability of P₀,
- exponential relaxation rate.
